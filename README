This is my Final Project for Digital Electronics - 

I am running an FM radio into a Teensy audio shield that has a Chorus and a Reverb effect from the Teensy Audio Library. 
There is also a Teensy 3.5 working with the 3.2 under the audio shield to take information from a collection of 7 knobs
that control the effects.

the "Digital_Final" code is the code running on the 3.5.
the "AudioSheild" code is the code running on the Audio Shield.
